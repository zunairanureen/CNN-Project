# COVID-19 Radiography Database Project

## Project Description

The COVID-19 Radiography Database project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to aid in the detection and classification of COVID-19 through radiographic images. This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains chest X-ray images categorized into three classes: COVID-19 and Normal. By training a neural network on this dataset, we seek to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- **Total Images**: Over 10,000 chest X-ray images.
- **Classes**:
  - COVID-19
  - Normal

These images were collected from various sources and represent diverse demographics, making the dataset a robust resource for training machine/deep learning models.

### Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the images for effective training.
2. **Model Development**: Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify the images.
3. **Training and Validation**: Train the model on the dataset and validate its performance using appropriate metrics.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.
5. **Deployment**: Create an interface to allow healthcare professionals to upload X-ray images and receive immediate classification results.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for development and testing
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code management and collaboration
